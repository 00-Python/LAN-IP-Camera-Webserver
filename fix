To install the required packages in Termux, you may need to follow these steps:

1. Update Termux packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

2. Install Python if you haven't already:
```sh
pkg install python
```

3. Install the required dependencies for building some of the packages:
```sh
pkg install clang python-dev libcrypt-dev libffi-dev openssl-dev
pkg install ffmpeg libjpeg-turbo
```

4. Install wheel and update pip to avoid some common issues:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

5. Install the required Python packages:
```sh
LDFLAGS="-L/system/lib/" CFLAGS="-I/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/include/" pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-SQLAlchemy Werkzeug opencv-python-headless numpy mtcnn
```

Please note that the `LDFLAGS` and `CFLAGS` environment variables are set before the `pip install` command to ensure that the compiler can find the necessary libraries and include files.

If you encounter issues with installing `cmake`, you can try installing it from the Termux repository:
```sh
pkg install cmake
```

If you still face issues with the installation, you may need to look for alternative ways to install or build the problematic packages, or seek help from the Termux community or the package maintainers.
